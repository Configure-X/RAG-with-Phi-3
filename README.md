# RAG with Phi-3 Notebook

## Overview
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with [Phi-3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct)
- Data: [100 LLM Papers to explore](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/100-llm-papers-to-explore)
- Works in a single P100 or in dual-T4
- You don't need any token or key to use Phi-3! ðŸ˜€
